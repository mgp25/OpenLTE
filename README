5) HackRF
6) bladeRF
7) polarssl
8) iptables

To build the C++ and python code use the following:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ../
  $ make

To install the C++ and python code use the following:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ../
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

All testing was performed against the following configuration:
- Intel Core i5-2557M
- Ubuntu 12.04
- GNU Radio 3.7.2
- GrOsmoSDR 0.1.1
- rtl-sdr 0.5
- UHD 3.6.0-1
- HackRF 0.2

#  FILE SCANNER  #
##################
To use the installed C++ and python code for the file scanner,
set the PYTHONPATH env variable to
<python_install_dir>/dist-packages/gnuradio/
for instance /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnuradio/
and make sure that /usr/local/lib is added to /etc/ld.so.conf
and that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to /usr/local/lib (export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib).  Then run LTE_fdd_dl_file_scan.py
and specify a recorded LTE file as the input. For example:

  $ LTE_fdd_dl_file_scan.py lte_file.bin

To see a list of options, use the -h option:

  $ LTE_fdd_dl_file_scan.py -h

To change the input file data type (int8 or gr_complex), use the
-d/--data-type option:

  $ LTE_fdd_dl_file_scan.py -d int8 lte_file.bin

For int8 data type, the recorded LTE file must be interleaved signed
8-bit I and Q samples.  For the gr_complex data type, the recorded
LTE file must be sequential gr_complex I/Q samples.  Files recorded
with LTE_file_recorder or generated with LTE_fdd_dl_file_gen can be
scanned with this application.

####################
#  FILE GENERATOR  #
####################
To use the installed C++ and python code for the file generator,
set the PYTHONPATH env variable to
<python_install_dir>/dist-packages/gnuradio/
for instance /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnuradio/
and that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to /usr/local/lib (export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib).  Then run LTE_fdd_dl_file_gen.py
and specify an output file for the LTE fdd downlink signal.
For example:

  $ LTE_fdd_dl_file_gen.py lte_file.bin

To see a list of options, use the -h option:

  $ LTE_fdd_dl_file_gen.py -h

To change the output file data type (int8 or gr_complex), use the
-d/--data-type option:

  $ LTE_fdd_dl_file_gen.py -d gr_complex lte_file.bin

For int8 data type, the generated LTE file contains interleaved
signed 8-bit I and Q samples.  For the gr_complex data type, the
generated LTE file contains sequential gr_complex I/Q samples.
Files generated with this application can be scanned with
LTE_fdd_dl_file_scan.

#  SCANNER  #
#############
To use the installed C++ live scanner, make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH
is set to /usr/local/lib (export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib),
plug in rtl-sdr, hackrf, USRP B2X0, or bladeRF hardware, run
LTE_fdd_dl_scan, and connect (via telnet, nc, etc) to the control
port at port number 20000.  Scan parameters can be changed and
scan results can be observed on the control port.  For a list of
parameters simply type help on the control port.

###################
#  FILE RECORDER  #
###################
To use the installed C++ file recorder, make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH
is set to /usr/local/lib (export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib),
plug in rtl-sdr, hackrf, USRP B2X0, or bladeRF hardware, run
LTE_file_recorder, and connect (via telnet, nc, etc) to the
control port at port number 25000.  Recording parameters can be
changed on the control port.  For a list of parameters simply type
help on the control port.  Files recorded using hackRF, USRP B2X0,
or bladeRF hardware are recorded using a sample rate of 15.36MHz.
Files recorded with all other hardware are recorded using a sample
rate of 1.92MHz.  All files recorded with this application can be
scanned with LTE_fdd_dl_file_scan.

############
#  ENODEB  #
############
To use the installed C++ eNodeB, make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set
to /usr/local/lib (export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib), plug in
USRP B2X0 hardware, run LTE_fdd_enodeb, and connect (via telnet, nc,
etc) to the control port at port number 30000.  eNodeB parameters
can be changed on the control port.  For a list of parameters simply
type help on the control port.  A MAC and above level PCAP trace is
output to /tmp/LTE_fdd_enodeb.pcap.  Data packets are routed through
a tun device named tun_openlte.  Wireshark can be used to observe
IP packets on tun_openlte to inspect the IP traffic to/from UEs. In
order to configure properly, set the ip_addr_start parameter to the
begining of a non-conflicting private address range (i.e. 10.0.0.1)
and set the dns_addr parameter to the primary DNS address listed by
your modem.  All UEs will be assigned IP addresses in the range
of ip_addr_start to ip_addr_start+254 and all traffic will be tunneled
through the tun device to the internet using NAT/iptables.
NOTES: This application has been tested exclusively at 5MHz
bandwidth.  Higher bandwidths are supported and performance may
vary based on processing hardware.
WARNINGS: By using this application you risk disruption of service in
a public network, even if you are not directly interfering with the
radio transmissions.  This is a criminal act in most countries, and a
much more serious offense than a simple violation of radio spectrum
regulaions.  It is highly recommended to use this application only
with antennas and test UEs inside an RF Shielded Enclosure (Faraday
Cage).

############
#  OCTAVE  #
############
To use the octave code, run the top level octave .m files:
lte_fdd_dl_transmit.m and lte_fdd_dl_receive.m.  If multiple
transmit antennas are used, the outputs need to be combined
before input to the receiver.
